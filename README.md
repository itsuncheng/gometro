## Tensorflow.js Real-time Object Recognition

This project is created while I was attending the Sydney | Hong Kong Ideation Exchange Program partnered between HKUST and the
Macquarie University. The topic is about how to make the transportation, specifically the metro system, more sustainable in 
Sydney and Hong Kong according to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Our idea was to provide a platform for the metro company to incorporate camera vision technology to their surveillance cameras
already existing in the stations, to more effectively synchronize the trains between stations to minimize the waiting times
for passengers. Very often, passengers have to wait for a long period of time for the next train to come in transfer stations,
and we firmly believe this issue can be avoided if the trains are synchronized correctly utilizing the real-time data of number
of passengers on each train platform. Thus, we propose a solution to live count the number of people using object detection
and provide easy visualization of the real-time data on graphs.
